## What are Listners
Following commands are used for configurations related to listners.
~~~

KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: 'PLAINTEXT'
KAFKA_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES: 'CONTROLLER'

KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS:'PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://broker:19092'
~~~
We'll learn the theory related to these commands which would help use understand the purpose of these commands. 
Let's start with some theory.  

*  **LISTENERS** are the network endpoints on which brokers listens for incoming connections.
* Each endpoint is defined by a listener name.
* Listeners are configured to handle different types of connections, and they can be associated with specific security protocols to control how data is transmitted and authenticated.

* A Kafka broker can have multiple listeners, each serving different purposes and potentially using different network interfaces and security configurations. These listeners are defined in the broker's configuration and dictate how clients and other brokers connect to it.

  
  

### Key Components of a Listener

1- **Name:** An identifier for the listener, such as PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL, CONTROLLER, etc.

~~~
	KAFKA_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES: 'CONTROLLER'
	KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME: 'PLAINTEXT'
~~~


> ***PLAINTEXT, SSL, SALS** are the network security protocols. For example, Plaintext means that there would be no encryption (not recommended for production, can only be used over a secure private network e.g. for broker internal network). For convenience, the name the listeners on the basis of these security protocols being used by them (a listener named 'PLAINTEXT') or the specific role the listener performs (a listener named 'CONTROLLER'). However, we are not stick to these, we can name as we like.*
> 
> ***CONTROLLER** is the Network Endpoint/Listener Name that will be used for controller communication by Kafka.(Kafka uses this to managae cluster).*
> 
> ***PLAINTEXT** is the Network Endpoint/Listener Name that will be used for ata-related communication (To separate contoller-related traffic and data related traffic between brokers).*


2- **Port:** The network port on which the listener accepts connections.
~~~
KAFKA_LISTENERS:'CONTROLLER://:29093,PLAINTEXT_HOST://:9092,PLAINTEXT://:19092'
~~~ 

> **CONTROLLER://:29093:** 
> * The listener 'CONTROLLER' is assigned port 29093. The controller is responsible for cluster management tasks like partition leader election, maintaining the cluster state, and handling broker failures. All the controller-related traffic will go through this port (controller-related traffic). This tells Kafka to listen for connections from other brokers (or itself in this case) on port 29093 using the internal `CONTROLLER` protocol for cluster management. 
> * Here, a question can be raised why '2' added before '9093'. The answer is, for current scenario, we have a single broker  in our cluster, configured at '9092' on our docker network, but we can have multiple brokers in our cluster. There may be a case where other broker is 	assigned port '9093' in our docker network. So to avoid such port conflict, we assigned port '29093' to our 'CONTROLLER' endpoint/listener. 
> * The port 29093 is arbitrarily chosen and does not need to match the external port 9092. The prefix 2 is simply a convention to differentiate this internal control port from the external client ports. It's not a requirement, but it helps to avoid port conflicts and makes the configuration clearer. 
> * In multi-broker Kafka setups, each broker typically gets its own dedicated internal port for inter-broker communication. This helps distinguish traffic between different brokers. In a single-broker setup, it's not strictly necessary, but some Kafka configurations still expect this pattern. We might see port numbers like `19092` or `29092` even though there's only one broker.*
> * *In **KRaft mode**, this listener plays a crucial role as each broker takes on the controller responsibilities.*

> **PLAINTEXT_HOST://:9092:** 
> * This is the listener that external clients will use to connect to the Kafka broker. It's mapped directly to the container's port 9092, which is the standard port for Kafka. This mapping allows clients outside the container to communicate with the Kafka broker using the standard port.
>* 'PLAINTEXT' is named after the security protocol being used. We have to keep in mind that external client connections (producers, consumers) comes from outside the Docker network. Here, it is using the `PLAINTEXT` protocol (no encryption) on port 9092. We can check the security protocols mapping command KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP' command. If this would have mapped SSL, we could've name it 'SSL_HOST'. 
> * All our external communication would be at port:9092. This is the standard port for client communication. It's where producers and consumers connect to interact with Kafka topics.*

> **PLAINTEXT://:19092:** 
> * This is our network endpoint/listener for inter-broker communication (i.e. communication related to data, other than controller-related). 'PLAINTEXT' is named after the security protocol being used. We can check the security protocols mapping command 'KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP' command. Since this communication is internal (inside docker network), we can use 'PLAINTEXT' 	protocol which means (without encryption).
>  * We use this listener for data replication and coordination between brokers that isn't specifically controller-related. This can help separate control traffic from data traffic, reducing the risk of bottlenecks and ensuring smoother operation.
> * *If we have producers and consumers in the same docker network, this endpoint can also be used to connect them with broker*.
>  It's how brokers share data, replicate messages, and keep each other informed about the state of partitions.



Remember, the `CONTROLLER://:29093` endpoint is used by Kafka and Kafka will communicate with all the brokers through this. While `PLAINTEXT://:19092` is the endpoint which is used by brokers to talk to each other or the producers and consumers within same network (docker network).

The reason for using different port numbers like 29093 and 19092 instead of just incrementing the last digit (e.g., 29092) is to provide a clear separation of concerns and to prevent port conflicts. Each listener serves a different purpose, and their port numbers help identify their roles within the Kafka ecosystem.

3- **Protocol:** The security protocol used by the listener, defined in KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP.

~~~
KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP:'CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT'
~~~
This environment variable in Apache Kafka is used to define the mapping between listener names and their associated security protocols e.g (PLAINTEXT, SSL, SASL_PLAINTEXT, and SASL_SSL.).This mapping tells Kafka which security protocol to use for each listener, allowing for different security configurations on different listeners.

It is used to:

* **Segregate Traffic**: Separate internal and external traffic by assigning different security protocols.
* **Enhance Security**: Apply different levels of security for different types of connections. For example, use SSL for client connections but PLAINTEXT for inter-broker communication within a trusted network.
* **Flexibility**: Allow different services to connect to Kafka using different security mechanisms, which can be particularly useful in multi-tenant environments or when integrating with various clients and systems.

Each comma separated value is like so `<listener_name>:<security_protocol>`
For Example **CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT** means listner name is CONTROLLER and mapped to security protocol PLAINTEXT.

And our configuration is like so
~~~
KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP:'CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT'
~~~
-   `  
    CONTROLLER` listener to `PLAINTEXT` protocol: Typically used for internal controller communication without encryption.
-   `PLAINTEXT` listener to `PLAINTEXT` protocol: Used for general client connections without encryption.
-   `PLAINTEXT_HOST` listener to `PLAINTEXT` protocol: Another listener for plaintext communication, likely for a different network endpoint.

## Listener Protocol Mappings
* `KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME:'PLAINTEXT'`
*As name implies, specifies the listener used for inter-broker communication.*

* `KAFKA_CONTROLLER_LISTENER_NAMES:'CONTROLLER'`
*Defines the listener names for controller communication.*
* `KAFKA_LISTENERS:'CONTROLLER://:29093,PLAINTEXT_HOST://:9092,PLAINTEXT://:19092'`
*Already explained in detail*
* `KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP:'CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT'` 
*Already explained in detail.*
* `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS:'PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://broker:19092'`
*Specifies the addresses and ports that clients and other brokers should use to connect to each broker.*
	> * This configuration is crucial for Kafka's networking and determines how Kafka tells other components (like clients and brokers in a multi-broker setup) how to connect to it. It's a list of listeners with their associated addresses and protocols, just like a business card. 
	> * `PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:9092` see it like this `<listener_name>:<address>:<port>` Since we are using it on our location machine, the address is localhost here.
	>* `PLAINTEXT://broker:19092` Here broker is the `hostname:broker` we used. Since it is inside docker network, we have given it a name which acts like a DNS. 

## Cluster Setup

* `KAFKA_PROCESS_ROLES:'broker,controller'`
*The role of the broker. In this case, it will act as a broker and also as controller. Since we are KRaft for managing cluster (not Zookeeper), in this mode, brokers can also take up role of controller to manage the cluster.*
	* **Is It OK for Each Broker to Have Both Roles?**
	*Yes, it is OK and even recommended in KRaft mode to have each broker also act as a controller. This design simplifies the architecture by eliminating the need for a separate ZooKeeper ensemble and allows the Kafka brokers to manage both data storage and cluster metadata. Each broker participating as both a broker and a controller ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

* `KAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS: '1@broker:29093'`
*Lists the nodes (a broker in a cluster is a node) participating in the controller quorum. Each node is listed with its ID and controller listener address.  In Kafka's KRaft mode, each broker acts as a controller, and a quorum of brokers is required for controller decisions and leadership election.* **Obviously, these are free and fair elections :)**
* `CLUSTER_ID:  '4L6g3nShT-eMCtK--X86sw'`
*Unique identifier for the Kafka Cluster.*

## Replication and Transactions
* `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR:  1`
	*This setting determines the replication factor for the internal Kafka topic used to store consumer offset positions.*
	>* *Offsets topics are part of Kafka's internal workings and are essential for managing consumer offsets, which are the positions of consumers within each partition of a topic.*
	>* *When a consumer group is created or when a consumer within a group starts consuming from a topic, Kafka automatically creates one or more offsets topics as necessary to store the offsets for the consumer group. These topics are created with names like `__consumer_offsets`.*
	>* *The number of partitions and the replication factor for these topics are determined by Kafka configuration settings, such as `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR`, which specifies the replication factor.*

* `KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR:  1`
*Defines the minimum number of in-sync replicas (ISR) required for the transaction state log topic before acknowledging a transaction.*
	> * *Kafka uses a transaction log to maintain the state of ongoing transactions in the system.*
	> * *This setting ensures that transactions are committed only when a certain number of replicas (ISR) are in sync with the leader, enhancing data consistency and fault tolerance.*
	> * *If the number of in-sync replicas falls below this minimum threshold, Kafka may halt transactional operations until the replicas catch up or additional replicas are added.*

* `KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR:  1`
*Specifies the replication factor for the transaction state log topic.*
	> * *This setting determines the replication factor for the transaction state log topic.*
	>* *Ensuring a sufficient replication factor for this topic guarantees fault tolerance and durability for transactional data.*
	>* *If a broker fails or becomes unavailable, Kafka can maintain transactional integrity by relying on replicas hosted on other brokers.*

## Timing and Logging
* `KAFKA_GROUP_INITIAL_REBALANCE_DELAY_MS:  0`
*Sets the initial delay (in milliseconds) before triggering consumer group rebalancing after a consumer joins or leaves a consumer group.*
	> * *When a consumer joins or leaves a group, Kafka initiates a rebalance to redistribute partitions among the consumers in the group.*
	>* *-   This configuration specifies the initial delay before starting the rebalance process after a change in group membership.*
	>* *-   A value of `0` means that the rebalance process starts immediately after a consumer joins or leaves the group. This can minimize the time it takes for partitions to be redistributed and for consumers to start processing messages from their assigned partitions.*
	>* *However, setting this value too low can potentially lead to more frequent rebalances, which may impact overall system performance and stability. It's important to consider the trade-offs and adjust this value based on the specific requirements and characteristics of  Kafka deployment.*

* `KAFKA_LOG_DIRS:  '/tmp/kraft-combined-logs'`
*Specifies the directory where Kafka stores its log files.*
	>* *Kafka stores its log segments, which contain the actual data, in directories specified by this setting.*
	>* *Each Kafka broker typically manages multiple partitions, and each partition has its own set of log segments.*
